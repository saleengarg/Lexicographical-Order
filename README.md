# Lexicographical-Order
Lexicographical Order is often known as alphabetical order when dealing with strings. A string is greater than another string if it comes later in a lexicographically sorted list.
Sorting words in lexicographical order mean that we want to arrange them first by the first letter of the word. Then for the words whose first letter is the same, we arrange them within that group by the second letter and so on just like in a language's dictionary(not the data structure).
